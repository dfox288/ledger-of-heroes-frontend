    /**
         * List all ability scores
         * @description Returns a paginated list of the 6 core ability scores in D&D 5e. Each ability score represents
         *     a fundamental character attribute that affects saving throws, skills, attack rolls, and damage.
         *
         *     **The Six Ability Scores:**
         *     - **Strength (STR):** Physical power, melee attacks, climbing, jumping, grappling (Athletics)
         *     - **Dexterity (DEX):** Agility, reflexes, ranged attacks, dodging, balance, stealth (Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth)
         *     - **Constitution (CON):** Endurance, health, hit points, concentration saves, resistance to poison/cold
         *     - **Intelligence (INT):** Reasoning, memory, nature, history, investigation (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion)
         *     - **Wisdom (WIS):** Awareness, intuition, perception, survival, insight (Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival)
         *     - **Charisma (CHA):** Force of personality, persuasion, deception, intimidation (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion)
         *
         *     **Examples:**
         *     ```
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/ability-scores              # All 6 ability scores
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/ability-scores?q=strength   # Search by name
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/ability-scores?q=str        # Search by code
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/ability-scores?per_page=10  # Custom page size
         *     ```
         *
         *     **Query Parameters:**
         *     - `q` (string): Search by name or code (partial match) - e.g., "str", "strength", "dex"
         *     - `per_page` (int): Results per page, 1-100 (default: 50)
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - **Character Building:** Determine which ability scores to prioritize based on class (Wizards need INT, Clerics need WIS, Rogues need DEX)
         *     - **Ability Score Checks:** Understand what modifiers apply to skill checks and saving throws
         *     - **Combat Analysis:** Know which abilities affect attack rolls, damage, and AC (DEX for AC, STR for melee attacks)

    /**
         * List all spells that require this ability score for saving throws
         * @description Returns a paginated list of spells that require saving throws using this ability score.
         *     Spells are ordered alphabetically by name and include relationships (spell school,
         *     sources, tags). Useful for building spell repertoires, targeting enemy weaknesses,
         *     and understanding spell distribution across saving throw types.
         *
         *     **Basic Examples:**
         *     - Dexterity saves: `GET /api/v1/ability-scores/DEX/spells` (Fireball, Lightning Bolt)
         *     - Wisdom saves: `GET /api/v1/ability-scores/WIS/spells` (Charm Person, Hold Person)
         *     - Constitution saves: `GET /api/v1/ability-scores/CON/spells` (Cloudkill, Stinking Cloud)
         *     - By name (lowercase): `GET /api/v1/ability-scores/dexterity/spells`
         *     - Pagination: `GET /api/v1/ability-scores/STR/spells?per_page=25`
         *
         *     **Common Save Distribution (Approximate):**
         *     - Dexterity (DEX): ~80 spells - Area damage (Fireball, Lightning Bolt), traps, explosions
         *     - Wisdom (WIS): ~60 spells - Mental effects (Charm Person, Fear, Hold Person), illusions
         *     - Constitution (CON): ~50 spells - Poison (Cloudkill), disease, exhaustion, concentration breaks
         *     - Intelligence (INT): ~15 spells - Psychic damage (Phantasmal Force), mental traps, mind control
         *     - Charisma (CHA): ~20 spells - Banishment, extraplanar effects (Banishment, Dispel Evil)
         *     - Strength (STR): ~25 spells - Physical restraint (Entangle, Web), grappling, forced movement
         *
         *     **Targeting Enemy Weaknesses:**
         *     - **Wizards/Sorcerers**: Low STR/CON - Use Entangle, Web, poison spells
         *     - **Fighters/Barbarians**: Low INT/WIS/CHA - Use charm, fear, banishment spells
         *     - **Rogues**: Low STR/WIS - Use grappling, charm, or fear effects
         *     - **Clerics/Druids**: Low DEX/INT - Use area damage (Fireball), psychic attacks
         *     - **Beasts/Constructs**: Low INT/CHA - Use mind-affecting spells (often immune, check first!)
         *     - **Undead**: Low CHA (usually) - Varies widely, check individual monster stats
         *
         *     **Save Effect Types:**
         *     - **Negates**: Save completely negates spell effect (Charm Person, Hold Person)
         *     - **Half Damage**: Save reduces damage by half (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, most evocation)
         *     - **Ends Effect**: Save ends ongoing effect (Fear - save at end of each turn)
         *     - **Reduced Duration**: Save shortens spell duration
         *
         *     **Building Save-Focused Characters:**
         *     - **Evocation Wizard**: Focus on DEX saves (Sculpt Spells lets allies auto-succeed)
         *     - **Enchantment Wizard**: Focus on WIS/CHA saves, boost DC with features
         *     - **Control Wizard**: Mix STR/DEX/WIS saves to target multiple weaknesses
         *     - **Debuff Cleric**: CON/WIS saves for poison, disease, mental effects
         *     - **Spell Selection**: Cover 3+ save types to handle different enemy stat arrays
         *
         *     **Spell DC Optimization:**
         *     - Base DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier
         *     - Boost DC: +1 items (Rod of the Pact Keeper), class features, spells (Bestow Curse)
         *     - Average DC by level: 13 (level 1), 15 (level 5), 17 (level 11), 19 (level 17)
         *     - Enemy saves scale slower than DC - advantage grows at higher levels
         *
         *     **Tactical Considerations:**
         *     - **Action Economy**: Save-or-suck spells (Hold Person) can eliminate threats instantly
         *     - **Concentration**: Many save spells require concentration - protect it!
         *     - **Legendary Resistance**: High-CR enemies can auto-succeed 3 times - burn through them
         *     - **Magic Resistance**: Some enemies have advantage on saves vs spells - still worth targeting weak saves
         *     - **Repeated Saves**: Some spells allow saves each round (Fear) - less reliable but safer
         *
         *     **Reference Data:**
         *     - 6 ability scores in D&D 5e (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA)
         *     - ~250+ total spells require saving throws (~50% of all spells)
         *     - Most common: DEX (~80 spells), WIS (~60 spells), CON (~50 spells)
         *     - Least common: INT (~15 spells) - exploit this vs low-INT enemies!
         *     - Save DCs range from 13 (level 1) to 19+ (level 17+)

         *     (Good to Evil), creating a 3x3 alignment matrix of 9 standard alignments plus special variants.
         *
         *     **Common Examples:**
         *     ```

         *
         *     **Good Alignments (Primarily benevolent):**
         *     - **Lawful Good:** Order and goodness (Paladins, Lawful Good clerics, noble knights)
         *     - **Neutral Good:** Goodness without rigid structure (Many clerics, some rangers)
         *     - **Chaotic Good:** Goodness with freedom and independence (Rogues, chaotic good monks)
         *
         *     **Neutral Alignments (Balance between law-chaos and good-evil):**
         *     - **Lawful Neutral:** Order without alignment toward good or evil (Monks, Paladins of justice)
         *     - **True Neutral:** Balance between all axes; "I'm just doing my thing" (Druids, some wizards)
         *     - **Chaotic Neutral:** Individualism without moral compass (Unpredictable, selfish creatures)
         *
         *     **Evil Alignments (Primarily malevolent):**
         *     - **Lawful Evil:** Organized, structured malevolence (Devils, tyrants, organized crime)
         *     - **Neutral Evil:** Evil without structure or chaos; purely selfish (Liches, some giants)
         *     - **Chaotic Evil:** Violent, destructive evil (Demons, marauding humanoids, berserkers)
         *
         *     **Special Alignments:**
         *     - **Unaligned:** Constructs, oozes, beasts without sapience (golems, oozes, animals)
         *     - **Any Alignment:** Humanoids that can be any alignment; player choice dependent (e.g., humanoid cultists)
         *     - **Varies:** Individual creatures within the type have different alignments (communities, factions)
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - Detect Evil and Good spell targeting (LG, NG, CG vs LE, NE, CE)
         *     - Paladin Divine Sense ability filtering
         *     - Monster filtering in encounter builders by moral/ethical profile

         *     **Armor Categories:**
         *     - **Light Armor:** Leather, Studded leather, Padded, Hierarchy - minimal penalty to Stealth
         *     - **Medium Armor:** Hide, Chain shirt, Scale mail, Breastplate - moderate AC, Stealth disadvantage
         *     - **Heavy Armor:** Chain mail, Plate armor, Ring mail - highest AC, limited mobility
         *     - **Natural Armor:** Dragon scales, Exoskeletons, Tough hide - innate creature protection
         *     - **Shields:** Wooden, Metal, Tower - combine with armor for bonus AC
         *
         *     **AC Calculation Reference:**
         *     - Light: 11 + DEX (Leather), 12 + DEX (Studded leather)
         *     - Medium: 13 + DEX (Hide), 14 + DEX (Scale mail), 14 + DEX (Breastplate)
         *     - Heavy: 16 (Chain mail), 18 (Plate armor) - no DEX bonus
         *     - Natural: Creature-specific (typically 12-15 base)
         *     - Shield: +2 AC when equipped with armor
         *
         *     **Query Parameters:**
         *     - `q` (string): Search by name (partial match)
         *

         *     - **Encounter Building:** Filter monsters by their armor type to balance party composition
         *     - **Spell Selection:** Choose spells effective against common armor types
         *     - **Equipment Planning:** Reference common armor types found in the campaign world
         *     - **Monster Analysis:** Understand how different creatures achieve their AC (armor vs. natural)
         *

         *     **Filterable Fields by Data Type:**
         *
         *     **Integer Fields** (Operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`):
         *     - `id` (int): Background ID
         *       - Examples: `id = 5`, `id >= 10`
         *
         *     **String Fields** (Operators: `=`, `!=`):
         *     - `name` (string): Background name (e.g., "Acolyte", "Criminal", "Noble", "Soldier")
         *       - Examples: `name = "Acolyte"`, `name != "Soldier"`
         *       - Use Case: Direct filtering by background name
         *     - `slug` (string): URL-friendly identifier (e.g., "acolyte", "criminal", "noble")
         *       - Examples: `slug = "acolyte"`, `slug != "criminal"`
         *
         *     **Boolean Fields** (Operators: `=`, `!=`, `IS NULL`, `EXISTS`):
         *     - `grants_language_choice` (bool): Whether this background grants player-choice languages
         *       - Examples: `grants_language_choice = true`, `grants_language_choice = false`
         *       - Use Case: Find backgrounds that offer language flexibility
         *
         *     **Array Fields** (Operators: `IN`, `NOT IN`, `IS EMPTY`):
         *     - `source_codes` (array): Source book codes (PHB, SCAG, XGE, TCoE, etc.)
         *       - Examples: `source_codes IN [PHB]`, `source_codes IN [PHB, XGE]`, `source_codes NOT IN [UA]`
         *       - Use Case: Filter by campaign-allowed sourcebooks
         *     - `tag_slugs` (array): Descriptive tag slugs (criminal, noble, outlander, sage, soldier, etc.)
         *       - Examples: `tag_slugs IN [criminal]`, `tag_slugs IN [criminal, noble]`
         *       - Use Case: Find backgrounds by archetype
         *     - `skill_proficiencies` (array): Skill names granted by this background
         *       - Examples: `skill_proficiencies IN [Insight]`, `skill_proficiencies IN [Insight, Religion]`
         *       - Use Case: Fill skill gaps in party composition (e.g., "Need someone with Insight")
         *     - `tool_proficiency_types` (array): Tool proficiency type names
         *       - Examples: `tool_proficiency_types IN [Thieves' Tools]`
         *       - Use Case: Find backgrounds for rogues/thieves
         *
         *     **Complex Filter Examples:**
         *     - Criminal backgrounds with Insight: `?filter=tag_slugs IN [criminal] AND skill_proficiencies IN [Insight]`
         *     - Backgrounds with language choices from PHB: `?filter=grants_language_choice = true AND source_codes IN [PHB]`
         *     - Non-PHB backgrounds: `?filter=source_codes NOT IN [PHB]`
         *     - Multiple skill requirements: `?filter=skill_proficiencies IN [Insight, Religion] AND source_codes IN [PHB]`
         *     - Search + filter: `?q=noble&filter=grants_language_choice = true`
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - **Character Creation:** Find backgrounds that grant specific skill proficiencies needed for your build
         *     - **Party Optimization:** Identify backgrounds that fill skill gaps (e.g., party needs Insight & Religion)
         *     - **Roleplay Choices:** Filter by tags to find backgrounds matching character concept (criminal, noble, etc.)
         *     - **Source Restrictions:** Limit to PHB-only for Adventurers League or homebrew campaigns
         *     - **Language Flexibility:** Find backgrounds granting language choices for multilingual characters
         *
         *     **Operator Reference:**
         *     See `docs/MEILISEARCH-FILTER-OPERATORS.md` for comprehensive operator documentation.
         *
         *     **Query Parameters:**
         *     - `q` (string): Full-text search (searches name, description, traits)
         *     - `filter` (string): Meilisearch filter expression

         *
         *     **Source Types:**
         *     - `race` - For Variant Human/Custom Lineage bonus feat. Excludes feats with
         *       ability score prerequisites entirely (can't meet them before scores assigned).
         *       This is RAW compliant and matches D&D Beyond behavior.
         *     - `asi` - For level 4+ ASI feat selection. Checks all prerequisites including
         *       ability scores against the character's current stats.
         *     - (none) - Same as `asi`, checks all prerequisites.
         *

         *     ```
         *     GET /api/v1/characters/1/available-feats?source=race  # Variant Human feat
         *     GET /api/v1/characters/1/available-feats?source=asi   # Level 4+ ASI feat
         *     GET /api/v1/characters/1/available-feats              # Default (same as asi)
         *     ```
         *
         *     **Prerequisite Checks:**
         *     - `Race` - Character's race (or parent race for subraces) must match
         *     - `AbilityScore` - Character's score must meet minimum_value (ASI only)
         *     - `ProficiencyType` - Character must have proficiency (e.g., Medium Armor)
         *     - `Skill` - Character must have skill proficiency (e.g., Athletics)
         *     - `CharacterClass` - Character must have the class
         *
         *     **Group Logic:**
         *     - Prerequisites with same `group_id` use OR logic (any one satisfies)
         *     - Prerequisites with different `group_id` use AND logic (all must be satisfied)
         *
         *     **Feats excluded for race source (~10 feats):**
         *     - Defensive Duelist (DEX 13+)
         *     - Grappler (STR 13+)

         *     ## Use Cases
         *
         *     **Character Creation**
         *     - Find base classes by primary ability: `filter=is_base_class = true AND primary_ability = "CHA"`
         *     - Compare hit dice for survivability: `filter=hit_die >= 10`
         *
         *     **Multiclass Planning**
         *     - Find compatible spellcasting abilities: `filter=spellcasting_ability = "CHA" AND max_spell_level >= 5`
         *     - Identify armor proficiency gaps: `filter=armor_proficiencies IN ["Heavy Armor"] AND is_base_class = true`
         *     - Save proficiency optimization: `filter=saving_throw_proficiencies IN ["WIS", "DEX"]` (best saves)

    /**
         * Get a single class
         * @description Returns detailed information about a specific class or subclass including parent class,
         *     subclasses, proficiencies, traits, features, level progression, spell slot tables,
         *     and counters. Supports selective relationship loading via the 'include' parameter.
         *
         *     ## Response Structure
         *
         *     The response separates data into three categories for API clarity:
         *     - **Base fields** - Core entity data (with inheritance resolved for subclasses)
         *     - **inherited_data** - Pre-resolved parent class data (subclasses only)
         *     - **computed** - Aggregated/calculated data for display optimization
         *
         *     ## Field Inheritance (Automatic)
         *
         *     D&D 5e subclasses inherit certain properties from their parent class. The API
         *     automatically resolves this inheritance in base fields:
         *
         *     - **hit_die**: Subclasses show inherited value (Death Domain → 8 from Cleric)
         *     - **spellcasting_ability**: Subclasses show inherited value (Death Domain → Wisdom from Cleric)
         *
         *     You never see raw database values (hit_die: 0 or spellcasting_ability: null) for subclasses.
         *     The effective values are always returned.
         *
         *     ## Computed Object (Display-Ready Data)
         *
         *     The `computed` object contains pre-computed fields to reduce frontend logic.
         *     Only included on show endpoint responses.
         *
         *     **computed.hit_points** - Pre-calculated D&D 5e hit point formulas:
         *     ```json
         *     {
         *       "hit_die": "d10",
         *       "hit_die_numeric": 10,
         *       "first_level": {"value": 10, "description": "10 + your Constitution modifier"},
         *       "higher_levels": {"roll": "1d10", "average": 6, "description": "1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st"}
         *     }
         *     ```
         *
         *     **computed.spell_slot_summary** - Spellcasting overview for UI column visibility:
         *     ```json
         *     {
         *       "has_spell_slots": true,
         *       "max_spell_level": 9,
         *       "available_levels": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
         *       "has_cantrips": true,
         *       "caster_type": "full"
         *     }
         *     ```
         *     - `caster_type`: "full" (9th level), "half" (5th level), "third" (4th level), or null (non-caster)
         *
         *     **computed.section_counts** - Relationship counts for lazy-loading accordion labels:
         *     ```json
         *     {
         *       "features": 34,
         *       "proficiencies": 12,
         *       "traits": 8,
         *       "subclasses": 7,
         *       "spells": 89,
         *       "counters": 3,
         *       "optional_features": 0
         *     }
         *     ```
         *
         *     **computed.progression_table** - Complete 20-level progression table:
         *     ```json
         *     {
         *       "columns": [
         *         {"key": "level", "label": "Level", "type": "integer"},
         *         {"key": "proficiency_bonus", "label": "Proficiency Bonus", "type": "bonus"},
         *         {"key": "features", "label": "Features", "type": "string"},
         *         {"key": "sneak_attack", "label": "Sneak Attack", "type": "dice"}
         *       ],
         *       "rows": [
         *         {"level": 1, "proficiency_bonus": "+2", "features": "Expertise, Sneak Attack", "sneak_attack": "1d6"},
         *         {"level": 2, "proficiency_bonus": "+2", "features": "Cunning Action", "sneak_attack": "1d6"}
         *       ]
         *     }
         *     ```
         *
         *     **Column Sources:**
         *     - **Feature data tables**: Parsed from feature descriptions (Monk's Martial Arts: 1d4→1d10)
         *     - **Roll elements**: From XML `<roll>` data (Rogue's Sneak Attack: 1d6→10d6)
         *     - **Synthetic data**: Hardcoded for prose-only progressions (Barbarian's Rage Damage: +2→+4)
         *     - **Counters**: Class counter values (Ki Points, Rage uses)
         *     - **Spell slots**: Cantrips known, 1st-9th level slots for casters
         *
         *     Values are interpolated (sparse data filled in for all 20 levels).
         *     Also available via dedicated endpoint: `GET /classes/{slug}/progression`
         *
         *     ## Inherited Data (Subclasses Only)
         *
         *     **inherited_data** - Pre-resolved parent class data for subclasses:
         *     ```json
         *     {
         *       "hit_die": 10,
         *       "hit_points": {...},
         *       "counters": [...],
         *       "traits": [...],
         *       "level_progression": [...],
         *       "equipment": [...],
         *       "proficiencies": [...],
         *       "spell_slot_summary": {...}
         *     }
         *     ```
         *     - Eliminates frontend inheritance resolution logic
         *     - Only present for subclasses (is_base_class = false)
         *     - Contains essential data from parent class that subclasses need
         *
         *     ## Feature Inheritance for Subclasses
         *
         *     - By default, subclasses return ALL features (inherited base class features + subclass-specific features)
         *     - Use `?include_base_features=false` to return only subclass-specific features
         *     - Base classes are unaffected by this parameter
         *
         *     ## Feature Choice Options (Nested Features)
         *
         *     Features that offer choices (like Fighting Style) have their options nested:
         *
         *     ```json
         *     {
         *       "feature_name": "Fighting Style",
         *       "is_choice_option": false,
         *       "parent_feature_id": null,
         *       "choice_options": [
         *         {"feature_name": "Fighting Style: Archery", "is_choice_option": true, "parent_feature_id": 397},
         *         {"feature_name": "Fighting Style: Defense", "is_choice_option": true, "parent_feature_id": 397}
         *       ]
         *     }
         *     ```
         *
         *     - **is_choice_option**: `true` if this feature is a choice under a parent (player picks one)
         *     - **parent_feature_id**: ID of the parent feature (null for top-level features)
         *     - **choice_options**: Nested array of child features (only present when loaded)
         *
         *     This allows frontends to:
         *     - Display choice options in a collapsible/grouped UI
         *     - Filter out choice options from main feature lists (check `is_choice_option`)
         *     - Show accurate feature counts (exclude choice options)
         *
         *     ## Examples
         *
         *     ```bash
         *     # Get Fighter with computed object
         *     GET /api/v1/classes/fighter
         *
         *     # Get Arcane Trickster (subclass) with inherited_data from Rogue parent
         *     GET /api/v1/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster
         *
         *     # Get only subclass-specific features (not inherited)
         *     GET /api/v1/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster?include_base_features=false
         *     ```
         *
         *     ## Note on Index vs Show
         *
         *     The `computed` object is **only included on show endpoint** for performance.
         *     Index endpoint returns base fields and relationships without computed data.

         *     - **Party composition:** "We need someone who speaks Undercommon for Underdark exploration"
         *     - **Multilingual characters:** Combine race language with background language for 3+ languages
         *
         *     **Language Distribution (Approximate):**
         *     - **Standard Languages** (all races): Common (30 races), Elvish (8 races), Dwarvish (4 races), Draconic (5 races)
         *     - **Exotic Languages** (rare): Abyssal (1 race), Infernal (2 races), Celestial (1 race), Deep Speech (0 races)
         *     - **Regional Languages:** Primordial (4 dialects), Sylvan (3 races), Undercommon (5 Underdark races)
         *
         *     **Character Building Tips:**
         *     - Most campaigns need Common + 1-2 specialized languages (dungeon exploration, diplomacy)
         *     - Choose languages based on campaign setting (Underdark → Undercommon, Planar → Infernal/Celestial)
         *     - Thieves' Cant is only available via Criminal/Urchin backgrounds (not racial)
         *     - Druids automatically learn Druidic (not queryable via this endpoint - class feature)
         *
         *     **Response Format:**
         *     Returns paginated race data with size, speed, sources, and traits. Default 50 results per page.
         *     Use `per_page` parameter to adjust pagination (max 100).

         * List all backgrounds that teach or grant this language
         * @description Returns backgrounds that provide access to this language, either as a fixed language grant
         *     or as a language choice. Use this to plan character backgrounds that grant specific languages
         *     or to understand which backgrounds provide linguistic diversity.
         *
         *     **Examples:**
         *     ```bash
         *     # By slug (most common)
         *     GET /api/v1/languages/thieves-cant/backgrounds
         *     GET /api/v1/languages/elvish/backgrounds
         *     GET /api/v1/languages/common/backgrounds
         *
         *     # By numeric ID
         *     GET /api/v1/languages/orc/backgrounds?per_page=20
         *     ```
         *
         *     **Common Language → Background Queries:**
         *     - **Thieves' Cant:** Criminal, Urchin (only these backgrounds teach this secret language!)
         *     - **Common:** Most backgrounds grant Common or assume it (universal language)
         *     - **Dwarvish:** Guild Artisan (if Dwarf-focused), Folk Hero (mountainous regions)
         *     - **Elvish:** Sage (elven libraries), Outlander (elven forests)
         *     - **Exotic Languages:** Acolyte (Celestial, Infernal), Sage (any language), Hermit (choice)
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - **Background selection:** "I want Thieves' Cant - which backgrounds work?" → Only Criminal/Urchin
         *     - **Language optimization:** "I need 3+ languages - which backgrounds help?" → Sage (2 choices), Acolyte (2 languages)
         *     - **Campaign alignment:** "Urban campaign needs urban languages" → Criminal, Charlatan, Urchin
         *     - **Rare language access:** "How do I get Deep Speech without being Far Realm-touched?" → Sage background
         *     - **Multilingual builds:** Combine race languages + background languages + class features
         *
         *     **Background Language Patterns:**
         *     - **Standard Backgrounds:** Grant 1-2 common languages (Common, regional language)
         *     - **Criminal/Urchin:** Only backgrounds that grant Thieves' Cant
         *     - **Sage:** Most flexible - can choose 2 languages from any list
         *     - **Acolyte:** Grants 2 languages (often Celestial or Infernal based on deity)
         *     - **Outlander:** Grants 1 language (often regional or tribal)
         *
         *     **Language Acquisition Priority:**
         *     1. **Race languages** (automatic, usually 2-3 languages including Common)
         *     2. **Background languages** (1-2 additional languages, often campaign-specific)
         *     3. **Class features** (Druid → Druidic, Ranger → one favored enemy language)
         *     4. **Feats** (Linguist feat → 3 additional languages + ciphers)
         *
         *     **Character Building Tips:**
         *     - Most characters start with 2-4 languages (race + background)
         *     - Choose background languages based on campaign (dungeon → Undercommon, planar → Infernal/Celestial)
         *     - Thieves' Cant is secret and not counted against language limits
         *     - Consider taking Sage background if you need rare languages (Deep Speech, Primordial)
         *     - Language proficiency can enable social encounters, lore discovery, and avoid combat
         *
         *     **Response Format:**
         *     Returns paginated background data with traits, proficiencies, and sources. Default 50 results per page.
         *     Use `per_page` parameter to adjust pagination (max 100).

         *     **Common Proficiency Queries:**
         *     - **Martial Weapons:** Longsword, Greatsword, Longbow → Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Barbarian
         *     - **Heavy Armor:** Plate, Chain Mail → Fighter, Paladin, Cleric (War/Forge domains)
         *     - **Skills:** Stealth → Rogue, Monk, Ranger | Perception → Ranger, Druid, Barbarian
         *     - **Tools:** Thieves' Tools → Rogue | Smith's Tools → Fighter (specific backgrounds)
         *     - **Languages:** Draconic → Sorcerer (Draconic Bloodline), Wizard
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - **Multiclass Planning:** "Which classes are proficient with longswords?" (Fighter, Paladin, etc.)
         *     - **Build Optimization:** "I want heavy armor - which classes work?" (Fighter, Paladin)
         *     - **Skill Coverage:** "Which classes are proficient in Perception?" (Rangers, Druids, Barbarians)
         *     - **Tool Requirements:** "Which classes can use Thieves' Tools?" (Rogue + specific subclasses)
         *     - **Character Concept:** "I want a Draconic speaker - which classes learn Draconic?" (Sorcerer, Wizard)
         *
         *     **Proficiency Distribution (Typical):**
         *     - **Martial Weapons:** ~8-12 classes (primarily martial classes + some subclasses)
         *     - **Heavy Armor:** ~6-8 classes (Fighter, Paladin, Cleric domains)
         *     - **Skills (Stealth):** ~4-6 classes (Rogue, Monk, Ranger, Bard)
         *     - **Skills (Perception):** ~8-10 classes (most common skill proficiency)
         *     - **Tools:** ~1-3 classes (highly specialized, often background-dependent)
         *     - **Languages:** Varies widely (Common: all classes, Exotic: 1-2 classes)
         *
         *     **Character Building Advice:**
         *     - **Weapon Proficiency Gaps:** If your class lacks martial weapon proficiency, consider:
         *       - Feat: Weapon Master (gain 4 weapon proficiencies + +1 STR/DEX)
         *       - Multiclass: 1 level Fighter (all weapons + armor + Fighting Style)
         *       - Race: Elf/Dwarf variants grant specific weapon proficiencies
         *     - **Armor Proficiency Progression:** Light → Medium → Heavy (each tier requires feat/multiclass)
         *     - **Skill Proficiency Limits:** Classes get 2-4 skills at creation, backgrounds add 2 more
         *     - **Tool Proficiency Value:** Often background-dependent, but Thieves' Tools universally useful
         *
         *     **Query Tips:**
         *     - Use name routing for readability: `/proficiency-types/Longsword/classes` vs `/proficiency-types/42/classes`
         *     - Results are alphabetically sorted for consistent browsing
         *     - Includes base classes AND subclasses (e.g., Eldritch Knight Fighter counts separately)
         *     - Check `parent_class_id` in response to distinguish base vs subclass

         *     **Common Racial Proficiency Queries:**
         *     - **Languages:** Elvish → Elf, Half-Elf | Dwarvish → Dwarf, Duergar | Draconic → Dragonborn
         *     - **Weapons:** Longsword, Shortsword → Elf variants | Battleaxe, Warhammer → Dwarf variants

         *     - **Armor:** Light/Medium Armor → Specific racial variants (rare, usually Mountain Dwarf)
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - **Language Planning:** "Which races speak Elvish?" (Elf, Half-Elf, High Elf)
         *     - **Weapon Synergies:** "I want longsword proficiency from race - which races work?" (Elves)
         *     - **Tool Proficiencies:** "Which races get Smith's Tools?" (Mountain Dwarf)
         *     - **Trait Coverage:** "Which races have Darkvision?" (Dwarf, Elf, Tiefling, Gnome, etc.)
         *     - **Build Optimization:** "I want a Fighter with elven weapon training - which elf subrace?"
         *
         *     **Proficiency Distribution (Typical):**
         *     - **Languages:** Common (all races), Elvish (~4 races), Dwarvish (~3 races), Draconic (~2 races)
         *     - **Weapons:** Elf variants (~3-4 races for longsword/bow), Dwarf variants (~2-3 for axes/hammers)
         *     - **Tools:** ~1-2 races per tool type (highly specialized)
         *     - **Darkvision:** ~12-15 races out of ~30 total (very common trait)
         *     - **Skills:** Rare as racial proficiencies (usually background-dependent)
         *
         *     **Character Building Advice:**
         *     - **Stacking Proficiencies:** Elf Fighter = Longsword prof from race + all martial weapons from class
         *     - **Unique Combinations:** Mountain Dwarf Wizard = Medium armor prof (normally Wizard has none!)
         *     - **Language Optimization:** Pick race based on campaign setting (Elvish for Faerun, Draconic for dragonlands)
         *     - **Darkvision Value:** Critical in dungeon-heavy campaigns, less useful in urban/outdoor settings
         *

         *     - **Languages:** Nearly all backgrounds grant 1-2 language choices
         *
         *     **Character Building Advice:**
         *     - **Skill Proficiency Overlap:** If background + class both grant same skill, you can swap ONE background skill
         *     - **Tool Proficiency Value:** Thieves' Tools (lockpicking) > other tools for dungeon delving
         *     - **Language Strategy:** Pick languages based on campaign (Undercommon for Underdark, Celestial for holy campaigns)
         *     - **Background Variants:** Many backgrounds have official variants (e.g., Criminal → Spy, same proficiencies)
         *
         *     **Typical Background Combinations:**
         *     - **Rogue + Criminal:** Double Stealth prof → swap to Perception or Insight
         *     - **Fighter + Soldier:** Double Athletics prof → swap to Intimidation or Survival
         *     - **Wizard + Sage:** Triple Intelligence skill coverage (Investigation, Arcana, History)
         *     - **Cleric + Acolyte:** Perfect thematic fit (Insight, Religion, holy proficiencies)
         *
         *     **Query Tips:**
         *     - Use name routing for readability: `/proficiency-types/Stealth/backgrounds` vs `/proficiency-types/12/backgrounds`
         *     - Results alphabetically sorted for consistent navigation
         *     - All backgrounds are base-level (no "sub-backgrounds" like races/classes have)
         *     - Check background description for thematic fit beyond mechanical proficiencies

         * List all item rarities
         * @description Returns distinct rarities from the items table. These represent the relative
         *     power and availability of magic items in D&D 5e, ordered from Common to Artifact.
         *
         *     **Magic Item Rarity Scale (D&D 5e Official):**
         *     - **Common** - Minor conveniences, cost 50-100 gp, no attunement
         *     - **Uncommon** - Low-level utility, cost 101-500 gp, optional attunement
         *     - **Rare** - Mid-level power, cost 501-5,000 gp, often requires attunement (levels 5-10)
         *     - **Very Rare** - High-level abilities, cost 5,001-50,000 gp, usually requires attunement (levels 11-16)
         *     - **Legendary** - Powerful artifacts, cost 50,001+ gp, requires attunement (levels 17+)
         *     - **Artifact** - World-defining items, priceless, major campaign implications
         *
         *     **Common Examples:**
         *     ```
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/rarities              # All rarities (6 standard D&D rarities)
         *     ```
         *
         *     **Character Level Guidelines:**
         *     - Level 1-4: Common, Uncommon items
         *     - Level 5-10: Uncommon, Rare items
         *     - Level 11-16: Rare, Very Rare items

         *     Returns grouped results with relevance ranking powered by Meilisearch. Perfect for implementing
         *     universal search bars, type-ahead autocomplete, and cross-entity content discovery.
         *
         *     **Basic Examples:**
         *     - Search everything: `GET /api/v1/search?q=fire`
         *     - Search by keyword: `GET /api/v1/search?q=dragon` (finds Dragon spells, Dragon race, Dragon monsters)
         *     - Search specific types: `GET /api/v1/search?q=healing&types=spells,items`
         *     - Limit results per type: `GET /api/v1/search?q=magic&limit=10` (10 per entity type)
         *     - Debug mode: `GET /api/v1/search?q=test&debug=true` (includes execution time, Meilisearch host)
         *
         *     **Type-Specific Search Examples:**
         *     - Spells only: `GET /api/v1/search?q=fireball&types=spells`

         *     - Exact matches (highest priority)
         *     - Prefix matches (e.g., "fire" matches "Fireball")
         *     - Typo tolerance (1-2 character differences)
         *     - Field importance (name > description)
         *     - Word proximity (closer words rank higher)
         *
         *     **Data Source:**
         *     - 477 spells, 516 items, 598 monsters, 131 classes
         *     - Races, subraces, backgrounds, feats from all D&D 5e sourcebooks
         *     - Indexed in Meilisearch for fast fuzzy search
         *     - Falls back to database LIKE queries if Meilisearch unavailable
         *
         *     **Example Frontend Implementation:**
         *     ```javascript
         *     // Universal search bar with type-ahead
         *     const searchAll = async (query) => {
         *       const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/search?q=${query}&limit=5`);
         *       const data = await response.json();
         *       return data.data; // { spells: [...], items: [...], ... }
         *     };
         *
         *     // Category-specific search (e.g., spell picker)
         *     const searchSpells = async (query) => {
         *       const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/search?q=${query}&types=spells&limit=10`);
         *       const data = await response.json();
         *       return data.data.spells; // Array of matching spells
         *     };
         *     ```
         *

         * List all creature sizes
         * @description Returns the 6 D&D 5e creature size categories used to classify all creatures, races, and monsters.
         *     Size determines space occupied, grappling rules, mounted combat eligibility, and movement constraints.
         *
         *     **Examples:**
         *     ```
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/sizes              # All 6 size categories
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/sizes?q=medium     # Search by name
         *     ```
         *
         *     **Size Categories:**
         *     - **Tiny (T):** Space: 2.5ft × 2.5ft (¼ square) | Examples: Imp, Sprite, Flying Snake
         *     - **Small (S):** Space: 5ft × 5ft (1 square) | Examples: Halfling, Gnome, Goblin, Kobold
         *     - **Medium (M):** Space: 5ft × 5ft (1 square) | Examples: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc (most races)
         *     - **Large (L):** Space: 10ft × 10ft (4 squares) | Examples: Ogre, Centaur, Young Dragon
         *     - **Huge (H):** Space: 15ft × 15ft (9 squares) | Examples: Giant, Adult Dragon, Purple Worm
         *     - **Gargantuan (G):** Space: 20ft × 20ft (16 squares) | Examples: Ancient Dragon, Kraken, Tarrasque
         *
         *     **Combat & Gameplay Implications:**
         *     - **Space Control:** Larger creatures occupy more squares and control more battlefield area
         *     - **Grappling:** Can only grapple creatures within one size category (Medium grapples Small/Medium/Large)
         *     - **Mounted Combat:** Mount must be one size larger than rider (Small rides Medium, Medium rides Large)
         *     - **Heavy Weapons:** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with Heavy weapons
         *     - **Movement:** Larger creatures struggle with narrow corridors and standard doorways (5ft wide)
         *     - **Squeezing:** Creatures can squeeze through spaces half their width at half speed with disadvantage
         *
         *     **Query Parameters:**
         *     - `q` (string): Search by name (partial match)
         *     - `per_page` (int): Results per page, 1-100 (default: 50)
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - **Race Selection:** "I want a Small race for mounted combat and stealth builds"
         *     - **Grappling Builds:** "Which size allows grappling the widest range of enemies?" (Medium)
         *     - **Encounter Design:** "What space requirements do I need for a Large boss fight?" (10ft × 10ft minimum)
         *     - **Mount Planning:** "My Small Halfling needs a Medium mount - what are the options?" (Pony, Wolf, Mastiff)
         *     - **Dungeon Navigation:** "Will a Large PC fit through standard 5ft doors?" (Yes, but squeezing)

         * List all monsters of this size category
         * @description Returns a paginated list of monsters that are of the specified size.
         *     Size affects encounter balance, tactics, space control, and environmental challenges.
         *
         *     **Examples:**
         *     ```bash
         *     # By code (T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan)
         *     GET /api/v1/sizes/T/monsters     # Tiny monsters

         *     ```
         *
         *     **Size Categories & Common Monsters:**

         *       - CR range: 0-30 (Ancient Vampire)
         *       - Includes iconic threats like Beholders, Mind Flayers

         *       - World-ending threats
         *       - CR range: 10-30 (Tarrasque)
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - **Encounter building:** "I need Large creatures for a CR 5 encounter in a 30ft × 30ft room"
         *     - **Tactical planning:** "Which Huge monsters can't fit through this 10ft tunnel?" (All of them!)
         *     - **Boss selection:** "Give me all Gargantuan monsters for a campaign finale" (16 options)
         *     - **Environmental challenges:** "Which monsters can squeeze through tight spaces?" (Tiny/Small)
         *     - **Space control:** "Which Large monsters have 10ft reach?" (filter by size, check actions)
         *
         *     **Combat Tactics by Monster Size:**
         *     - **Tiny/Small monsters:**
         *       - Use in swarms (5-10 creatures)
         *       - Focus on mobility and stealth
         *       - Gang up for Pack Tactics advantage
         *       - Easy to hit (low AC typical) but numerous
         *     - **Medium monsters:**
         *       - Standard 5ft reach, 5ft × 5ft space
         *       - Most versatile size for varied tactics
         *       - Can navigate any terrain
         *     - **Large monsters:**
         *       - Often 10ft reach (control 24 squares!)
         *       - Block doorways and corridors
         *       - 4× space of Medium (tactical positioning critical)
         *       - Grapple up to Huge creatures
         *     - **Huge monsters:**
         *       - 15ft reach possible (control 48 squares!)
         *       - Dominate battlefield positioning
         *       - Cannot fit through 10ft doors
         *       - Legendary boss-tier threats
         *     - **Gargantuan monsters:**
         *       - 20ft reach typical (control 80+ squares!)
         *       - Outdoor-only encounters (can't fit in dungeons)
         *       - Siege-scale threats
         *       - Legendary Actions almost guaranteed
         *
         *     **Encounter Design Considerations:**
         *     - **Space required:** Large needs 10ft × 10ft, Huge needs 15ft × 15ft, Gargantuan needs 20ft × 20ft
         *     - **Reach zones:** Large creatures with 10ft reach control massive areas (don't bunch up!)
         *     - **Terrain challenges:** Huge+ creatures can't fit through standard dungeon corridors (10ft wide)
         *     - **Grappling threat:** Large+ monsters can grapple and restrain Medium PCs easily
         *     - **Action economy:** Use multiple Small/Medium monsters vs single Large+ for balance
         *
         *     **CR Distribution by Size:**
         *     - Tiny: Mostly CR 0-4 (swarm fodder, scouts)
         *     - Small: CR 0-8 (goblinoids, common threats)
         *     - Medium: CR 0-30 (full range, most versatile)
         *     - Large: CR 1-22 (mid-tier bosses, dragons)
         *     - Huge: CR 4-24 (high-tier bosses, ancient dragons)
         *     - Gargantuan: CR 10-30 (legendary encounters only)
         *
         *     **Environmental Constraints:**
         *     - **Standard door:** 5ft wide (Large+ squeeze, Huge+ cannot fit)
         *     - **Wide corridor:** 10ft wide (Huge+ squeeze, Gargantuan cannot fit)
         *     - **Cavern/outdoor:** Only limitation is Gargantuan (20ft × 20ft minimum)
         *     - **Flying creatures:** Size matters less (can maneuver in 3D space)

         *
         *     **Tag System Overview:**
         *     Tags are polymorphic labels applied to entities for semantic categorization. Each tag has:
         *     - **id** (int): Unique tag identifier
         *     - **name** (string): Human-readable display name (e.g., "Ritual", "Concentration")

         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/tags?type=monster       # Monster-specific tags (e.g., "Legendary", "Fiend")
         *     GET /api/v1/lookups/tags?type=item          # Item-specific tags (e.g., "Magic", "Artifact")
         *     ```
         *
         *     **Spell Tag Examples:**
         *     - "Ritual" - Can be cast as a ritual without using spell slot
         *     - "Concentration" - Requires concentration to maintain the spell
         *     - "Healing" - Provides restoration or damage recovery
         *     - "Control" - Manipulates enemy movement or positioning
         *
         *     **Monster Tag Examples:**
         *     - "Legendary" - Has legendary actions
         *     - "Lair Actions" - Has lair-based abilities
         *     - "Fiend" - Creature type classification
         *
         *     **Item Tag Examples:**
         *     - "Artifact" - Legendary item of great power
         *     - "Magical" - Enchanted or magical item
         *     - "Cursed" - Has curse mechanics
         *     - "Wondrous" - Miscellaneous magical item

         *     - `type` (string): Filter tags by entity type (spell, monster, item, race, class, feat, background)
         *

         *     {"selected": ["option1", "option2"]}
         *     ```
         *     The `selected` array contains IDs or slugs of the chosen options.
         *
         *     **Equipment Choice with Category Options**:
         *     ```json
         *     {"selected": ["b"], "item_selections": {"b": ["phb:drum"]}}
         *     ```
         *     When an equipment option is a category (e.g., "any musical instrument"),
         *     use `item_selections` to specify which item(s) from that category.
         *
         *     **ASI Choice** (Ability Score Improvement):
         *     ```json
         *     {"type": "asi", "increases": {"strength": 2, "dexterity": 1}}
         *     ```
         *     The `increases` object maps ability names to increase amounts (1 or 2).
         *
         *     **Feat Choice**:
         *     ```json
         *     {"type": "feat", "feat": "phb:alert"}
         *     ```
